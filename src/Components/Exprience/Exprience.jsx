            It was an internship of a Mern stack developer for 3 months. In
            this, I was working on the frontend and backend parts of the
            website. for the frontend part, I worked on tech stacks like
            Reactjs, tailwind CSS, and npm; for the backend part I worked on
            tech stacks like node.js, express.js, and MongoDB.
